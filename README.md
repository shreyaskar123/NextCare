# NextCare
NextCare performs early diagnosis by discriminating between speech and motor patterns of patients with and without PD. Specifically, cardinal PD symptoms, specifically involuntary shaking, which is termed Parkinsonian Tremor, and slowness in movement, which is termed bradykinesia, is quantified using signal processing and machine learning techniques through a 3D printed wearable device shown here. These quantified symptoms are continuously monitored and stored, in real-time, in a cloud database. Lastly, NextCare provides a mobile app for the end-user so neurologists and other other physicians can continuously monitor disease progression and get instant diagnosis results.
